This project is a part of the Module 10 challenge in the Vanderbilt University Data Analytics BootCamp and is written entirely by the author of the repository. This README template is from the Data Science Working Group.

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to conduct exploratory data analysis across a SQL database and create an API from the output of initial analysis. This is a useful application for using Python to organize data from a relational database as well as converting data from a relational database into a user-friendly API.

### Methods Used
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* HTML Webpage Design
* API Requests
* Relational Database Interaction

### Technologies
* HTML
* Python
* Pandas, jupyter
* SQLite

## Project Description
The data source for this project comes from Mockaroo, a data generator useful for demoing new software. This limits the data analysis to entirely hypothetical for a Hawaiian vacation; although, the API would be very useful for finding the time of the year with the best weather for a trip to Hawaii using 6 year olds data. The primary  methods used in the project could be applied to any given relational database to procure and clean data from a database and create an API from the clean data.
